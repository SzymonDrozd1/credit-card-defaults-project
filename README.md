# credit-card-defaults-project

# Description
A bank wants to build a model to predict credit card defaulters more accurately in order to minimize money loss. For this task, we have a set of data on default payments and demographic data to help us do our task. Data is comprised of CSV files located in data tab, each file containing a set of information related to 20,000 customers.

# Steps taken in the project
- Loading and merging all the tables
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis: creating multiple graph and drawing insights
- Build a machine learning model to predict the probability of default
- Find 1000 customers who are the most likely to repay the loan
- Optimize the threshold of the model considering customers who do not repay cost the bank 5000$ and customers who repay profit the bank 1000$
